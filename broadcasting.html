	<p>The concept of the <font color="red"><b>Camerata Singers</b></font> originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall’Osto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotter’s Markets in the mall. </p>
	<p>The Camerata Singers comprises a group of <font color="red"><b>trained singers</b></font>, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions.</p>

		<p>One of the most important aspects of my role as a singing teacher is to provide my students with current, research based information on how to better their technique and protect vocal health. This is a passion of mine.</p>
		<p>At SING SMART STUDIOS I foster a culture where students are encouraged to use their musical gifts and talents to reach out and have a positive impact on the community in which they live.<font color="red"> <b> Feel free to join us!</b></font>
