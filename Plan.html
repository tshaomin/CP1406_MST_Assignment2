<h1> CP1406 - 2017 Project Plan</h1>
<b>Members:</b> S. Saad Mohsin, Tiffany Teo Shao Min, Matthew Cabinian
<h2>Mission</h2>
Our mission is to be recruiting of new members to join the club. <br>
Increasing of engagement of members in our events or activities held. For instance, volunteering in organising events or even endorsing our workshops to let us be more known to the public. Moreover, to increase of ticket sales to the public. Urge the performers to let us manage their concert and encourage them to accommodate with promotion, photo shootings.
<br>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
The number of events undertaken by the music club like promotions, photo shoots, media releases, etc. The number of new members who sign up using the website every month.

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
We provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of style and categories which otherwise have little exposure, therefore our target audience includes a wide range of ages be it elderly, young adults or childrens. However, if children below 18 are involved, parents or family members have to lead them along. Every concert, therefore need a peculiar theme. If every concert have the same theme, it would be monotonous. Hence, different theme would lighten up the atmosphere.
