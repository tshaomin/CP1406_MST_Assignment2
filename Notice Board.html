The Notice Board is a free service, intended not only for selling or advertising, but also for any items of news or general interest. Photos may be included.
Any person can contribute an item, but each item will be rejected or accepted by its relevance to the "musical community," that is, musicians, teachers, students, etc.
The contributor is responsible for the integrity of the information they provide.
Music Centre will not be involved in any way in the sale of goods advertised on this page. 
Items will be published for an appropriate time; say 2 weeks for a photo or news item, up to 2 months for items on sale.

       <p style="text-align:justify"> To promote live performances, we must keep production costs to a minimum.<br> 
The Townsville City Council assists us by allowing many tasks to be done by volunteers. <br>
		   Most volunteer activities do not require any special skills e.g. setting out or stacking chairs.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify"> Ushers play a special role, taking tickets at the door and ensuring the comfort and safety of all patrons. <br>
A brief, free training session is compulsory for this role, to learn theatre policy, emergency evacuation procedures, etc. <br>
Ushers are then registered with Civic Theatre management and may work at many theatre performances throughout the year.<br>

        <h3> Our Live House Music Service</h3>
        <h4> Performance opportunities for music students</h4>
         <p style="text-align: justify">The Music Centre have a series of Sunday afternoon concerts at C2 and Friends of the Theatre have regular variety concerts at Pimlico PAC, also on Sunday afternoons.<br> <br>

Instead of playing bland recorded music before the show, we prefer to have student musicians playing on stage when the doors open.<br>
For the musicians, this is effectively a practice session with a live audience; they don't have to "perform", they can stop and start as they please. They need to be of reasonably high standard, but they don't have to be polished performers.  The students are then welcome to stay for the concert.<br> <br>

The students are considered volunteers, but we can help pay for expenses incurred.<br>

Small instrumental groups are preferred. The offer is open to all schools, so we need to schedule in advance.<br><br>

If you would like to take part, please let us know so we can send you a list of concert dates as soon as they are confirmed.<br>
