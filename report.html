    <h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
    <p>brief details of who did what</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tiffany: </strong> Created on the Introduction, Index, Daily Affair, and Broadcasting webpages. Not only that, did the Announcement navigation, Sign up navigation and footer.  Moreover, did all the compilation of webpages and even the slide show. Implemented on the javascript, editing on all the css to make it fit the computer.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Saad: </strong>Created the Notice Board. Worked with the Top navigation and created the banner for the webpage.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Matthew: </strong> Created the About us, Sign up and join us webpages and a contributor to the layout of the webpage and how each webpage should be presented and researcher for new html, css or even javascript codes		</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Testing Details</h2>
    <p>any details required to test the site, including usernames, passwords, instructions if needed, outstanding issues (like things that look as though they work but don't)
	<li>In order to have the website look the absolute best, it was decided to make sure that the website is able to fit on 1 of our 3 laptops and be presentable as intended.</li>
	<li>The survey was tested by adding separate information that is invalid to ensure that the alert menu would make sure that the code can recognize wrong information that was typed in.</li>
	<li>Group member Tiffany, tested the webpages created not only by her but also from Saad and Matthew in order to test if the code carries on to a different screen with different resolution along with the CSS styling of each webpage</li>
	<li>Since many of our screen resolutions were not the same, the main way to test the sizes of each boxes, was to use the sizing code "EM" in order for the sizes to fit on any resolution</li>

    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong>
	<li>One of the biggest advantages with working in the group was that we were able to share the knowledge and different codes we used during the first assessment and allowed us to create a website with so many combinations of code and design skills.</li>
	<li>Communication was strong since that all members were working on their own individual webpages, all members kept asking for feedback and for improvements or any additional codes to input to their webpage.</li>
	<li>During our time creating, lots of ideas were presented on not only on how to design the pages, but also what the content should be itself</li>
	</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong>
	<li>One of the problems we faced was that besides class, time was very restricted due to class timings or no time to meet up to work on the webpage together.</li>
	<li>Another problem faced was that since we had multiple computers, we had 2 macbooks and 1 windows computer. We had to make sure that it worked on Tiffany's computer along with the sizes and the positions</li>
	<li>When creating the webpages, many of the codes had either similar or the same attributes or ids or classes, so the codes overlapped each other and this caused a lot of confusion between the group</li>
	<li>The javascript aspect of the website was not polished enough as it was the group's first time experimenting and testing the javascript commands and the different options available to the group.</li>
	</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> 
	<li>With 3 people working on figuring out how to use javascript, many options were presented in a way that allowed us to present the information for certain webpages</li><br>
	<li>Figuring out how do we made the information to scroll-left and scroll up. </li>
