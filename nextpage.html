	<p>Poms from Oz are <font color="red">Judy, Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy </font> , a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland, Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First Fleeters. </p>

<p>Their tight harmony and vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar and/or harmonica. Their sound is distinctive, as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices.</p> 

<p>A tast brew of Oz songs and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red , sit back and enjoy.<b> For further information or bookings <font color="red"> contact the Music Centre  4724 2086. </font></b> or
